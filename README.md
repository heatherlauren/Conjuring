#Conjuring

This is the source code for the visual arts project 'Conjuring', shown by Heather Davidson at ESAF 2016.

conjuringtext.py prints an infinite loop of non-functional but syntactically correct Python code.

conjuringlights.py controls an alternating light pattern on a Unicorn HAT.

You may wonder why this needs to exist.

Hey, that's art for you.
