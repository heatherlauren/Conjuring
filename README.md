#Conjuring

This is the source code for the visual arts project 'Conjuring', shown by Heather Davidson at ESAF 2016.

It prints an inifnite loop of non-functional but syntactically correct Python code, while simultaniously controlling a Unicorn HAT.

You may wonder why this needs to exist. Hey, that's art for you.
